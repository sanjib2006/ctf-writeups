### Challenge Description
The challenge description indicates to check the cookies 
>Cookie Monster has hidden his top-secret cookie recipe somewhere on his website. As an aspiring cookie detective, your mission is to uncover this delectable secret. Can you outsmart Cookie Monster and find the hidden recipe? You can access the Cookie Monster [here](http://verbal-sleep.picoctf.net:49737/) and good luck.

## Solution
Turn on Developer Tools and open the Storage Tab(in Firefox) to check the cookies.
We find a cookie with name = `secret_recipe` and value = `cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzXzk4RDA2MDNGfQ%3D%3D`

The value seems to be url encoded base64 string.
After URL Decoding we get `cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzXzk4RDA2MDNGfQ==`
and after base64 decoding we get:
```bash
$ echo "cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzXzk4RDA2MDNGfQ==" | base64 -d
